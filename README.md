# Proof-of-Stake ETF
A coin built on top of the Algorand Blockchain (AKA an *Algorand Standard Asset* / *ASA*) that functions as an ETF whose net value represents the top 10 Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrencies in circulation.

Currently, the value of this coin is determined by the Net Asset Value of the underlying assets. The ETF is weighted by market cap, but this is likely to change.
